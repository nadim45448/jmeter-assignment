## Overview
This project includes two main tasks:
1. Booking API Performance Testing (https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com):
   - Perform load and stress testing on the booking API.
   - Simulate 120,000 users over a 12-hour period performing login(/auth), create booking(/booking), and search booking operations(/booking/<booking_id&gt)
   - Generate HTML reports and Excel summaries for both load and stress test
   - Parameters:
        - Users: 12000
        - Time: 12 Hours
        - Error Threshold: 0.5%
        - Timer: Gaussian Random Timer (Deviation 2000ms, Constant delay 500ms)
     
2. DMoney API Functional Testing (http://dmoney.roadtocareer.net):
   - Simulate transactions such as deposits(/transaction/deposit), money transfers(/transaction/sendmoney), and payments(/transaction/payment) using CSV data.
   - Validate all transactions using assertions.
   - Generate an HTML report for the test results.
   - Scenario:
        - 5 agents perform deposits for 10 customers,
        - 5 customers send money to another 10 customers,
        - 5 customers make payments to 2 merchants.
   - Parameters:
        - Ramp-Up time: 120 seconds.
  
## Tools and Technologies I have used:
   - Postman
   - JMeter
   - Git and GitHub
   - Excel

## Prerequisites
   Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:
   1. JMeetr:
      - download and install Apache jMeter from https://jmeter.apache.org/ .
      - Ensure Jmeter is added to your system's PATH for easy execution.
   2. Java:
       - JMeter requires Java to run. Install Java JDK version 8 or higher.
       - Ensure Java is added to your system's PATH.
   3. Git:
       - Install Git to clone this repository.
   4. CSV Files:
       - The CSV files (deposit.csv, sendmoney.csv, payment.csv ) are prepopulated with sample data. Modify them as needed for your tests.
  
  ## How to Run the Tests<br>
   **Booking API Tests**
  1. Clone the Repository: 
   ``` git clone https://github.com/nadim45448/jmeter-assignment ```
  3. Run the Load Test and Generate HTML report
     - Execute the booking.jmx file using JMeter:
      ``` jmeter -n -t booking.jmx -l booking.jtl -e -o Reports ```       
     - Replace -l booking.jtl with the desired output file name.
  4. Open the index.html file in the Reports/ folder to view the results.
  5. Stress rest:
     - Follow the same steps as the load test but adjust the number of threads/users in the Thread Group.
    
  **DMoney API Test:**
  1. Run the Test Plan and Generate HTML Report
     - Execute the dmoney.jmx file using JMeter: 
      ``` jmeter -n -t dmoney.jmx -l dmoney.jtl -e -o Reports ```
  2.   Open the index.html file in the Reports/ folder to view the results.
